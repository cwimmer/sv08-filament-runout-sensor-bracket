# On Components and Suppliers

TODO: This needs to be truncated or expanded as needed by the project.

## Suppliers

In the Bill of Materials, I list various suppliers.  You do not have to purchase the components from the same suppliers.  These parts will fulfill the requirements of this design, but you may select equivalent parts from any supplier.

## Materials

### 3D Printer Filament

I selected ASA as the filament.  You may substitute the material of your choice.  Just ensure you understand the material properties meet your load requirements.

### Fasteners

I've specified stainless steel fasteners.  You may choose any material you wish for your fasteners as long as you weigh the material change against your load requirements.

### Plywood

I've chosen MDF and Baltic Birch for the plywood portion of assembly.  

## Standards

All fasteners I've used in my testing conform to ISO 4762.
