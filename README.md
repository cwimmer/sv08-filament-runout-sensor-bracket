## General Notes

1. Unless otherwise specified, dimensions are in millimeters.
2. The CAD diagrams in the CAD directory are the authoritative definition of this assembly.
3. Standard hardware (screws, nuts, washers, T-nuts, etc.) is **not modeled** in the CAD assemblies. Holes, clearances, and interfaces are shown; the fasteners themselves are specified in [`BOM.md`](./BOM.md) and [`ASSEMBLY.md`](./ASSEMBLY.md). If there is ever a conflict, treat `BOM.md` as the source of truth for hardware type and quantity.
